Motivation
----------
With an increasing number of applications moving to MicroServices / Distributed Architecture, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep all of them on agreeable terms.

**Integration Testing is not an option** given the expense (cost and time) and effort involved in building and maintaining a comprehensive suite.

Below are features that we think are necessary to getting contract testing right.

* **Architecture Independence** - Should not be limited to REST or other simple API setup. It should support asynchronous integrations and integrations through other tools such as message queues, databases, memory, file etc.
* **Approach Independence** - Should not be limited to Client Before Server approach. It should suit equally well to a Client Before Server, Server Before Client or a Contract First approach.
* **Language / Tooling Independence** - Since MicroServices promote polyglot programming, it is important that the tool remains agnostic to any specific language or platform.

Philosophy
----------
We acknowledge that such a tool is not just solving the contract testing problem, it is also **Engineering the interaction between individuals and teams in an organisation**. While we have designed the tool such that it can be adopted with minimal changes to the way a team works, it is **opinionated towards promoting collaboration** while architecting APIs.
