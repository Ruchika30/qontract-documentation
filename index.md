Qontract
========
Qontract is a "Contract First" contract testing tool.

* **Human readable contracts** - It leverages **Gherkin**'s strength as a specification mechanism to define APIs.
* **Backward Compatibility verification** - Contract vs Contract testing (cross version compatibility checks) etc.
* **Contract as Stub / Mock** - Run stubs / mocks that are based on your downstream contracts to isolate your development
* **Contract as Test** - Test drive your APIs with contract
* **Programmatic** (Kotlin, Java and JVM languages) **and Command line support**
